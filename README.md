# A beginner's guide to neural networks for social scientists

📍 Hybrid Event: MZES, Mannheim + Zoom

📆 October 18, 2023

Neural networks are powerful machine learning algorithms that form the basis of many important technologies, including generative AI and computer vision. However, they are not as straight-forward to implement as many other machine learning techniques, like random forest or logistic regression. If you are a researcher interested in applying neural networks, this tutorial will provide an easy introduction to what neural networks are, how they work, and how you can implement a simple one yourself.
